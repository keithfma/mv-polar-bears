# Martha's Vineyard Polar Bears Data Analysis & Visualization

Exploration of attendence data from the MV Polar Bears group. The short term
goal is to build some interactive plots for members to play with. The long-term
goal is to build an attendence predictor.

This repo generates two products:

1. A blog post, created once and hosted at http://www.allnans.com/jekyll/update/2018/07/19/mv-polar-bears.html
1. A dashboard, refreshed regularly and hosted at https://mvpolarbears.allnans.com

The dashboard can also be added to a Facebook Page as a a "Page Tab". To do
this, simply visit the URL below, and select the page you wish to add it to. 

https://www.facebook.com/dialog/pagetab?app_id=1885448688215245&redirect_uri=https://mvpolarbears.allnans.com

Note that this only works for organizational pages, for some crazy reason you
cannot add a tab to a personal page.
